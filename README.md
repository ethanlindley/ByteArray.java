# ByteArray.java (Under development)

A very simple script for writing and reading bytes in Java

This supports **Big endian and Little endian**.

This is my very first experience with Java. Java seems to be similar to Kotlin, but Java is able to use Little endian. I recommend switching over to Java if you're using Kotlin.
